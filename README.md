# Capstone 1 - SOP Global Summit

> In this project, I built two pages (home page and about page) of an imaginary summit event. The design was based on a previous design by Cindy Shin at Behance. I personalized it to a summit on climate change, which is one of the many problems we face as a global community. By completing this project, I have demonstrated mastery in UI design using HTML and CSS and an ability to use JavaScript to manipulate events. This project also signifies my completion of module 1 in the Microverse curriculum.
